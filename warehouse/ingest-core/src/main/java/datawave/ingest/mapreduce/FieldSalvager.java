/**
 * This optional interface is intended to complement the IngestHelperInterface interface's handling of errors that occur
 * within ingest jobs.
 *
 * One use case is when IngestHelperInterface's getEventFields throws an exception.  The getEventFields method will not
 * return a Multimap of field values (because it instead threw an exception).  Prior to FieldSalvager, this meant that the
 * error tables would not have information on any of the RawRecordContainer's field values.
 *
 * FieldSalvager implementations can attempt to provide a subset of the field values, so that the error tables can have
 * more helpful information about the failed record, perhaps aiding troubleshooting efforts.  An implementation could
 * return only those field names that are relatively well-structured and predictably formatted, very unlikely to cause
 * exceptions while processing.
